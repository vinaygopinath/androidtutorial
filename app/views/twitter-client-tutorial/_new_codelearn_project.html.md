# Creating New Project

In the previous lesson, we installed Codelearn Eclipse Plugin. Instead of following the regular process of creating a New Android project, the plugin comes with a 'Codelearn Twitter App' project pre-bundled. When you create a new Android project, it asks for quite a few parameters which are confusing for a newbie. We have condensed all those steps by providing default values. 

Lets create the new Codelearn Twitter App.

1. You should have Eclipse open. Hit on File -> New -> Other. You will see a window popup as shown below. It is a 'New Project wizard' of Eclipse.

2. Under 'Codelearn Android Project', select 'Twitter App'. You should see an app with name 'CodelearnTwitterApp' in the package Explorer Window (the project navigation window on the left). Screenshot below.

3. Before watching the content of the app, lets get it running first. Hit the **Run button** at the top (the green play button). A selection window shows up. This is 'Run Configuration Selector' window of Eclipse. A project can have multiple **run configurations**. The default run configuration for an Android app is 'Android Application' but in our case, you should select 'Android App Codelearn'. This configuration does the default Android App deployment & also test your application to show you logical errors & possible remedies. It also lets us keep track of your tutorial completion progress.
