# Module 3 - HTTP operations

Our Twitter app skips the login process altogether and presents dummy tweets. In this module, we will wire up the app to make real network calls to a server. We will begin this task by replacing the existing login mechanism with real HTTP requests, move on to fetch tweets from server, submit new tweets

This module deals with the following concepts

* Submitting data to a server using HTTP POST calls
* Fetching data from a server using HTTP GET calls
* Using external libraries in an Android project
* Using Twitter4J to access actual Twitter data
* Using simple ActionBar menu items for navigation and frequently used operations
