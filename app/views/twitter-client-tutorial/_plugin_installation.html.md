# Welcome to our first Android Tutorial

As part of the tutorial, you will build a Twitter client. The development process followed is how developers actually develop an app from scratch. 

To make it newbie friendly, we have tweaked the process a bit to keep the easier concepts (User Interface elements) earlier in the roadmap & deferred hard to perceive concepts (models, network calls etc) later. We have refrained ourselves from using difficult words (also jargons). So it may happen that you would already know an Android concept, but you would not know the technical name of the concept. 
As a mobile app developer, it should not matter to you. But if discover this fact later, please do not blame us. 

## Target Audience

If you belong to one of these categories, you are the kind of audience we looking for.

* Hacker kind of people
* People who have prior java knowledge
* People having no/little knowledge of Android (including the guys who have never made an Android app earlier)

## Getting Started

To assist you better during the development cycle, we have created an Eclipse plugin that tests your app at every step to ensure you are doing it right. Our intent is to be able to show you very relevant error message (& possible solution). But this is a pretty tricky problem to address & we are hoping that we will be getting better with time. 

Follow the steps below to get started

* Install Android SDK (ignore if you already have it installed) from [Official Android page](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download). It is a zip file that you need to download & unzip. 
* Download the [plugin zip](). Unzip it. You will see a bunch of jar files & a zip file. 
* Copy all the extracted files in [Eclipse Home Folder] -> dropins directory. The location of Eclipse home folder is inside the Android SDK you downloaded in step 1. **dropins** directory exists for you to manually 'drop' an Eclipse plugin there.

* Open your Eclipse by double clicking the Eclipse icon in your Android SDK. You should see a welcome popup. Great, you are all set now.
