#Android Widgets / View Elements

Any Android app is made up of a lot of Activities, and all the Activities have User interface. Android provides us a lot of prebuilt user interface elements to create a nice looking UI for our app.

In a previous chapter, you have seen how to leverage different layouts to give structure to your application's User Interface. The layout is just an empty placeholder for Android views. Let us see some of the most used Android Layout widgets and some of its interesting properties. 

In Android, all layouts are XML based. Even though you get a nice graphical editor, ultimately the elements are nothing but XML code. Let's take a brief look at both :

##Graphical Layout
If you open any Layout in ADT, you will see 2 tabs like the one in this image 
<br/>
<%= image_tag "android_widgets/tabs.png", alt: "Layout Tabs", title: "Layout Tabs" %>

To open Graphical Layout for dragging and dropping UI elements, just click on the Graphical Layout tab.

This is how the Graphical Layout Editor looks like :
<br/>
<%= image_tag "android_widgets/layout_editor.png", alt: "Layout Editor", title: "Layout Editor" %>

Let us see what are its sub components

###Palette
Palette section has all your basic UI elements categorized into different sections, like Form Widgets, TextFields, Layouts etc. You can just choose any Element by Dragging and Dropping it to the working area on the right of the Screen. 

###Control Bar 
The top bar which you see with options like Nexus one, App Theme etc. is called control bar. It has different options to test the UI against different conditions. You can control the size of the screen, orientation,theme etc. from this bar. You can also change Zoom level, check lint warnings etc. from this bar. 

###Design Area
The remaining area to the right side of the palette is the Design Area. Here, you can drag and drop elements to add in the UI, rearrange already added elements, reorder them, change their properties, etc. 


##Common Attributes and Properties

All UI elements are of type View and have some common properties which are useful to understand their behavior. Whenever you drag and drop a UI element from Designer view, it also automatically generate at least these 3 properties of the view.

###android:id 
It is used to identify a particular View in Java Code. When you assign an ID to a View, it makes that view uniquely identifiable through this ID in that Layout. In later chapters, we will see the use of ID in details. 

Here is how it will look like in code
        android:id="@+id/textView1"

###android:layout_width 
layout_width property of view defines the width of that view. You should define width in px or dp.

###android:layout_height
layout_height property of view defines the height of that view. You should define height in px or dp.


Here is how Height and Width will look into code

        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"

Since all UI elements are inherited from view, all have an onClick property. We will explore onClick for some of the UI elements. 

Here are some common attributes or terminology which will be good to understand before watching UI elements in action

###wrap_content
This is the value which you can assign to layout's width or height. This tells android to make the size of the UI element just equal to the size of content which the UI has.

For example, a text view with the text "HELLO" with width as wrap_content will only be 5 characters wide(as HELLO is 5 characters wide). 

###match_parent or fill_parent 
Always use match_parent over fill_parent, even though both means same. This value is again to be assigned to width or height. This tells android to match the view's height or width to its parent's height or width. If the parent is taking full size on screen, setting this value on any UI element will also make its height or width equal to the screen size.

###dp 
Dp is density independent pixels. As Android devices comes with different density of the screen, this value can be used instead of PX (pixle). If you use dp, Android will automatically calculate px for you based on the screen of the android device. 

For Example: On some device 1 dp might be equal to 1 px but on some device 1dp = 5px

###Padding 
Padding is the space inside the border, between the border and the actual view's content. Padding is always inside the view and goes completely around content. You can set padding on all 4 sides, or on an individual side. 

For Example: If you set padding property in EditText, the cursor inside the EditText will move. 

Here is how Padding looks in code: 

For all sides 

        android:padding="2dp"

For Individual Sides

        android:paddingLeft="2dp"
        android:paddingRight="3dp"
        android:paddingTop="5dp"
        android:paddingBottom="8dp

###Margin
Margins are the spaces outside the border, between the border and the other elements next to this view, IE margin is the outside view, it is a space between 2 views, whenever you want to give space between 2 views you can use Margin. 

For Example: If you set margin in EditText, the EditText will move by that value from it's parent view.

Here is how Margin will Look at the code: 

For all sides 

        android:layout_margin="2dp"

For Individual Sides

        android:layout_marginLeft="2dp"
        android:layout_marginRight="3dp"
        android:layout_marginTop="5dp"
        android:layout_marginBottom="8dp


You might wonder what is the difference between margin and padding. Let's see an Image to Understand better. 

<br/>
<%= image_tag "android_widgets/padding_Margin.jpg", alt: "Padding and Margin", title: "Padding and Margin" %>

In the image, margin is the gray area outside the entire object. The border is the point where your view ends. 

Margin and Padding are the same concept, as in CSS.

###Gravity
Whenever you want to align content inside the view, use gravity. android:gravity sets the gravity of the content of the View its used on. Android Gravity, when applied on a view, specifies the direction of its content to be aligned. 

For Example: In A Linear Layout when you set Gravity to Center, all its View will get Center aligned.

This is how you set the gravity of layout 
        android:gravity="center"

###Layout Gravity
Layout Gravity is the Outside gravity of the View. It sets the gravity of the View or Layout in its parent.

Here is how you set layout gravity
        android:layout_gravity="right"

HTML/CSS Equivalents:

android:layout_gravity = float in CSS

android:gravity = text-align in CSS

###'android:' namespace

You might wonder why all properties start with android:`. If you notice the first line of any XML file there is a namespace definition :

      xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
   
Notice the attribute android here, which is referring to Android Schema. This Schema has all references to values like id, text other attributes. You can read more about XML Schema from [this link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema)

##TextView

Textview is most simple UI element. It is used to display static text, which cannot be changed by the user. 

In HTML world, TextView is nothing but a Label. 

Lets see some of the useful properties of TextView

###android:text 
This property defines the text which will come inside the TextView

###android:textColor

This property defines the color of text. This take HexaDecimal text color for example #ffff00 

###android:textSize

This property defines the size of text. It takes values in Sp. For example "15sp"


###Example 
This is how a simple textview looks in code. 

        <TextView
                android:id="@+id/textView1"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Hello World" 
                android:textColor="#ffff00"
                android:textSize="15sp"/>

A lot of time you require to set the text of TextView Dynamically via code. Let's see how we can change the text of textView via code.

First Step is to get reference of TextView. 

        TextView txtView = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.textView1);

Here you call findViewByID method by passing the android:id of the TextView. 

Since all the UI elements are view, findViewbyId returns a view object which we need to typecase into correct subview, in this case TextView.

Now, to change the text just call setText method on the txtView object as :
        
        txtView.setText("Set your Text Here"); 

With these 2 simple lines of code, you can change the text of textview dynamically

##EditText

EditText is another most used UI element in Android. Whenever you want to take some input from the user, you can use EditText. 

In HTML world EditText is nothing but an input tag. 

Lets see some useful properties of EditText

**android:text** : this property defines the text which will come inside the EditText, or the text which user will enter. Typically in Java code, once you have the reference of editText object, this is the property which you call to get the value which user might have set.

**android:hint**: this property defines the hint which you want to give to user, this hint appear inside the edittext but gets disappear once user start typing anything inside the edit text

**android:ems**: this property defines how many characters long the text should be. Since there is no text inside edit text, making it wrap_content will not help. This property helps you in defining the exact width for edit text. 

**android:background**: this property defines the background of the edit text. You can either choose a color or set an image as the background of the edit text.

**android:inputType**: this property defines what kind of content the edit text will contain.

For Example: **textPassword** will make the text automatically converted into * as user starts typing. **Number** will change the keyboard layout to numeric, hence helping the user to type the number faster.

This is a very powerful property of EditText and if you know what kind of content your EditText needs, make sure to define that using inputType. 

###Code
This is how a simple editText will look like

		<EditText
		        android:id="@+id/editText1"
		        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
		        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
		        android:ems="10" 
		        android:text="Pranay"
		        android:hint="Enter User Name"
		        android:background="#ff0000"
		        android:inputType="text">

Most of the times, you would want to get the value of EditText or prepopulate the value dynamically. Let's see how we can do this in code.

First let get the reference of the EditText 

        EditText edtText = (EditText)findViewById(R.id.editText1);

As discussed earlier, we just call findViewById to get the reference of a view in code.

Now to get the content of the edit text, just call getText method, like this 

        edtText.getText()

Similar to TextView, to set the text of EditText, you can call

        edtText.setText("Set your value")

##Button

###What
Button is the most used UI element in Android. For every action you want to do, you want the user to click on a button. 

###Properties
Lets see some of the useful properties of a Button

**android:text** : this property defines the text which will come on the top of a button. You can change the text dynamically through code

**android:textColor**: this property defines the color of text on the button. This take HexaDecimal text color for example #ffff00 

**android:background**: this property defines the background of the button. You can either choose a color or set a image as background of the button

**android:clickable** : this property makes the button enabled or disabled. This takes boolean values (false/true)

###Click Listener
Button is made to be clicked. Lets see how we can add a click listener to the button. Even though you can directly define a method from the UI which should be called when button is clicked, the best way to do it is using code.

Get the object of the button in code. 

        Button b = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button1);

if you notice the above code, you create a button object and then call findViewByID method by passing the android:id of the button. 

Since all the UI elements are view, findViewbyId returns a view object which we need to typecast into correct sub view. 

Add listener

        b.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
            
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                
                // Do what you want after button click here
            }
        });
In the above code, you add a click listener to the button. Whenever the button is clicked , the onclick method of button is called. 

###Code
This is how a button will look in XML code

        <Button
        android:id="@+id/button1"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:background="#f23400"
        android:clickable="false"
        android:text="Button" />

Similar to editText and textView you can call **setText** method on the button object to change the text on the button dynamically.

##ImageView

###What
Any android app is incomplete without use of an image. Image View is the UI control which you can use to display image in your android app. 

In html, image view is simply img tag. 

###Properties
Lets see some of the useful properties of Image View

**android:src** : The most important property of ImageView is src . This property helps you to define the image which will be displayed in the image view. You can pass android drawable or your own drawable. Let's see an example

         android:src="@drawable/ic_launcher" 

Here "@drawable" refers to your drawable folder which is present inside res folder. After that, you put the image name without the extension. 

**android:contentDescription** : This is not a required property, but it is recommended to set this property. ContentDescription is a text description of the image which you have set. This property helps with accessibility. If this property is set, users facing difficulty in viewing the image can use a Screen Reader, which will read out the text from content description. 

###Code
This is how an ImageView will look in XML code

        <ImageView
                android:id="@+id/imageView1"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:contentDescription="Image Description"
                android:src="@drawable/ic_launcher" />

A lot of time you would want to change the image of ImageView dynamically from the code. Let us see how we can do that.

Let's get the reference of image view 
        ImageView imView = (ImageView)findViewById(R.id.imageView1);

Once we have the image view object, we can call setImageResource method to change the image. You can pass the drawable which you want to set to the imageview .

        imView.setImageResource(R.drawable.new_image);


##RadioButton

###What
If you want your users to pick one from a set of options, use Radio button. 

In HTML the input type="radio" is radio button. 

###Properties
Let's see what are the properties of radio button

**RadioGroup** : Radio button does not reside on its own. A radio button will always be inside a Radio Group. Radio Group can have multiple radio buttons. All the radio buttons inside the radio group will have a Click event which will be invoked when user selects the radio button. 

For example : 

        <RadioGroup
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:orientation="vertical">

The orientation of radio group helps you in aligning radio button in vertical or horizontal format. 

**android:text** : Android text property of a radio button is used for putting text in radio button. 

**android:checked** : Checked property of radio button lets you define preselected/default selected option in a radio group. For example: if you have 3 radio buttons you can use this property in any one button to make it selected by default.

        android:checked="true"

###Click listener
Radio buttons are created to be clicked. In a radio group, all the radio buttons will have a click listener. This click listener will be invoked when the user will click on any of the radio button. There are multiple way to add a click listener, but simple way is to do in code using android:onClick property of a radio button. 

Lets see an example 

         <RadioButton
                    android:id="@+id/radio_code"
                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:onClick="onRadioButtonClicked"
                    android:text="Code" />

         <RadioButton
                    android:id="@+id/radio_learn"
                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:onClick="onRadioButtonClicked"
                    android:text="Learn" 
                    android:checked="true"
                    />

In the above example, notice the property onClick. Since these 2 radio buttons reside in the same radio group, both have a same click listener. 

Here is how the click method looks

        public void onRadioButtonClicked(View view) {
            // Is the button now checked?
            boolean checked = ((RadioButton) view).isChecked();
            
            // Check which radio button was clicked
            switch(view.getId()) {
                case R.id.radio_code:
                    if (checked)
                        // Code option selected
                    break;
                case R.id.radio_learn:
                    if (checked)
                        // Learn Option Selected
                    break;
            }
        }

You can create a method in your code, in which you define onClick action of a radio button. In this method, you can get the id of the radio via  **view.getId()** . Once you have the id, you can use a switch case statement to determine which radio button was clicked by checking **view.isChecked()** 

With a simple code, you can know which radio button selection was made.

### Code
Here is how the complete Radio button declaration will look inside the XML

         <RadioGroup
                android:layout_width="fill_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:orientation="vertical" >
                 
                 <RadioButton
                                    android:id="@+id/radio_code"
                                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                    android:onClick="onRadioButtonClicked"
                                    android:text="Code" />

                <RadioButton
                                    android:id="@+id/radio_learn"
                                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                    android:onClick="onRadioButtonClicked"
                                    android:text="Learn" 
                                    android:checked="true"
                                    />
        </RadioGroup>


##CheckBox

###What
If you want to select one or more options from a set, use Check Box. 

In HTML the input type="checkbox" is checkbox. 

###Properties
Let's see what are the properties of checkbox. Most of the properties of checkbox and radio button are similar.

**android:text** : this property of a  checkbox is used for putting text in a radio button. 

**android:checked** : Checked property of checbox lets you have the checkbox checked by default. 

        android:checked="true"

###Click listener
All the checkbox will have click listener. You can have a common click listener or different click listeners. This click listener will be invoked when the user will select or unselect any checkbox. There are multiple way to add a click listener, but simple way is to do in code using android:onClick property of checkbox. 

Let's see an example 

        <CheckBox android:id="@+id/feedback"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Feeback"
                android:onClick="onCheckboxClicked"/>
            
            <CheckBox android:id="@+id/collectdata"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Collect Data"
                android:onClick="onCheckboxClicked"/>

In the above example notice the property onClick. You can either have a common click listener for all the checkbox or can have their individual clicklisteners. 

Here is how a common click method looks like :

        public void onCheckboxClicked(View view) {
            // Is the view now checked?
            boolean checked = ((CheckBox) view).isChecked();
            
            // Check which checkbox was clicked
            switch(view.getId()) {
                case R.id.feedback:
                    if (checked)
                        // send feedback
                    else
                        // don't send feedback
                    break;
                case R.id.collectdata:
                    if (checked)
                        // Collect Data
                    else
                        // Don't collect data
                    break;
            }
        }

You can create a method in your code in which you define onClick event of a Checkbox. Similar to radio button, in this method, you can get the id of the checbox via  **view.getId()**. Once you have the id, you can use a switch case statement to determine which checbox was clicked.  Then you can use **view.isChecked()** to determine if the button was checked or unchecked.

With this simple code, you can find out the state of the check box.


##ListView

###What
Whenever you have a date which is repeated and comes as a collection or list, list view is best User Interface element to use. ListView helps you to display repeating data in the form of a scrollable list. Users can then select any list item by clicking on it. 

The ListView is widely used in android applications. A simpler example of list view is your contact book, where you have a list of your contacts displayed in a list view. 

> Listview is a complex UI pattern, and we have a separate section about listview. You can read more about list view in ListView Section


##GridView

###What
When you have data which you want to display as a grid of row and columns, you can use gridview. GridView displays item in 2 dimensional scrollable grid. 

The most simple example of gridview is your Picture Gallery, In Picture Gallery all the pictures are arranged in a grid like format.

> You can read more about gridview at this link : http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/gridview.html

##ScrollView

###What
ScrollView helps you in making any Layout automatically scrollable. When you are not using listview and have content which is going beyond the screen size, you can use scroll view to make this content scrollable. 

###Properties

The most important property of Scroll View is it's children. ScrollView can only have 1 child. It means that you need to have all your layouts nested under 1 layout which acts as a children of your list view. 

Let's see an Example: 

Let's assume we have 2 edit Text in our layouts like this 

         <EditText
                        android:id="@+id/editText1"
                        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                        android:ems="10" 
                        android:text="Pranay"
                        android:hint="Enter User Name"
                        android:background="#ff0000"
                        android:inputType="text">

        <EditText
                        android:id="@+id/editText2"
                        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                        android:ems="10" 
                        android:text="Airan"
                        android:hint="Enter Password"
                        android:background="#ff0000"
                        android:inputType="text">

Now if we want to make our UI with these 2 Edit Text Scrollable, we need to put them into a parent layout. ScrollView cannot have 2 children, so we cannot put this edit text into a scroll view directly. 

Let's add a Linear layout as a parent of this edit text. 


         <LinearLayout
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:orientation="vertical" >

                 <EditText
                                android:id="@+id/editText1"
                                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                android:ems="10" 
                                android:text="Pranay"
                                android:hint="Enter User Name"
                                android:background="#ff0000"
                                android:inputType="text">

                <EditText
                                android:id="@+id/editText2"
                                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                android:ems="10" 
                                android:text="Airan"
                                android:hint="Enter Password"
                                android:background="#ff0000"
                                android:inputType="text">

        </LinearLayout>

Now that we have both the edit Text into 1 layout, we can put this Linear layout as child of a ScrollView. You can then go on and add more complex elements inside this layout and all the elements will now be scrollable.

###code
This is how our complete scroll view will look

        <ScrollView
          android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
          android:layout_width="wrap_content">

         <LinearLayout
                        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                        android:orientation="vertical" >

                         <EditText
                                        android:id="@+id/editText1"
                                        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                        android:ems="10" 
                                        android:text="Pranay"
                                        android:hint="Enter User Name"
                                        android:background="#ff0000"
                                        android:inputType="text">

                        <EditText
                                        android:id="@+id/editText2"
                                        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                                        android:ems="10" 
                                        android:text="Airan"
                                        android:hint="Enter Password"
                                        android:background="#ff0000"
                                        android:inputType="text">

                </LinearLayout>
        </ScrollView>

Android has a lot of UI elements which are designed for specific purposes, in this chapter we tried to cover some of the most used UI elements. If you want to read more about other UI controls, you can go to [this link](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/index.html)
