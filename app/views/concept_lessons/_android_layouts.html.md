# Relative Layout

Relative layout is also one of the basic layout available to design UI. It arranges its views with reference to the view siblings or with parent. That is, using Relative layout you can mention a view to be onLeft, onRight, onBottom, toTop of its siblings. You can also mention/position a view with respect to its parent.

## Create a layout:

Go to layout folder of the project and create a new xml file. ( By default there will be activity_mail.xml). You can use this xml as well. In the below screenshot, I have renamed it.
