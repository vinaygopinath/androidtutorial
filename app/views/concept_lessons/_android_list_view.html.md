#Android ListView
<!--
ListView in Android is a view group that displays a list of scrollable items. If you have a date which is repeated in the form of a collection or list, the listview is the best User Interface element to use. ListView helps you in displaying repeating data in the form of a scrollable list. Users can then select any listitem by clicking on it. 
-->

ListView is widely used in Android Applications. A simple example of ListView is your contact book, where you have a list of your contacts displayed in a ListView. 

<br/>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span4">
		<%= image_tag "list_view/twitter_home.png", alt: "ListView Example Twitter", title: "ListView Example Twitter" %>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<%= image_tag "list_view/list-view-example-1.jpg", alt: "ListView Example Example ", title: "ListView Example" %>
	</div>
	<div class="span4">
		<%= image_tag "list_view/list-view-popup.png", alt: "ListView Example popup", title: "ListView Example popup" %>
	</div>
</div>

Let's take an example: 

Have a look at the screenshot of the twitter app described above.


All the rows are similar, and the only thing which changes is the tweet content. Such situation drives us to use ListView.

##Using ListView In Android

Android provides ListView or ExpandableListView. ExpandableListView contains list items which can be expanded. To use a listview in Android you can drag and drop the listview control from the palette to your UI. 

Here is how listview code looks: 

        <ListView
            android:id="@+id/listView1"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content" >
        </ListView>


##ListItem

A listview is made from a group of list items. List items are individual rows in listview where the data will be displayed. Any data in listview is displayed only through listItem. Consider Listview as scrollable group of list items. 

List items are just layouts in a separate layout file. Let us understand the following example. 
 

<%= image_tag "list_view/twitter_tweet.png", alt: "Twitter tweet", title: "Twitter tweet" %>

Here we can see a listitem for the twitter application. This list Item is arranged in a Relative layout with images and multiple text views aligned to each other. This is how a listview is designed.

Once we have the listitem, we bind the listview to the Adapter and then use list items to display the data in listview. 

In the coming sections, we will learn more about how we create custom list items and how to attach them to the Adapter.

##Adapter

Android Adapter is a bridge between the View (e.g. ListView) and the underlying data for that view. An adapter manages the data and adapts the data to the individual rows (listItems) of the view.

We bind the adapter with listview via *setAdapter* method. 
Now, Let us see how adapter works with the help of the following image.

<%= image_tag "list_view/Adapter.png", alt: "Adapters", title: "Adapters" %> 

As stated earlier, Adapters act as a bridge to the views. To interact with the view, adapters call the getView() method which returns a view for each item within the adapter view. This is a listitem which we have seen earlier. The layout format and the corresponding data for an item within the adapter view are set in the getView() method.  

Once we have a reference to the view, we can get the data from the data source either in an Array list or a cursor. We can then bind the data to the view items. All this is done in getView Method. In coming sections, we will look as to how we can achieve this in our code.

>Watchout: Typically as you scroll the listview to improve the performance and save time in creating a new view , Android recycles the views that go out of focus. 


Typically you do not have to deal directly with the Adapter class. Android provides you commonly used Adapters like :

*Array Adapter
*Cursor Adapter
*Simple Cursor Adapter

Most of the time we tend to write our own Adapter by extending *BaseAdapter*

>Watchout: Always remember that any adapter will always expect a Layout to be bound    to(i.e listitem).

Enough of wait, Let's see Adapters in Action now.

##Basic ListView with ArrayAdapter

###ArrayAdapter

Whenever you have a list of single items which is backed by an array, you can use ArrayAdapter. For instance, list of countries or names.

By default, ArrayAdapter expects a Layout with single TextView. If you want to use more complex views, please avoid ArrayAdapter and use custom adapter(we will see this in the next section).

###Android ListView Example (ArrayAdapter)
Download our Example App from [here](https://github.com/pranayairan/Code-Learn-Android-Example/tree/master/CodeLearnListExample)

Open ListViewWithSimpleAdapter Class

For ArrayAdapter to work you need to have an array of data, let's create an Array of Code Learn Tutorial Chapter: 

        String[] codeLearnChapters = new String[] { "Android Introduction","Android Setup/Installation","Android Hello World","Android Layouts/Viewgroups","Android Activity & Lifecycle","Intents in Android"};

Since we have the data now, let's create a new Object of ArrayAdapter. 

        ArrayAdapter<String> codeLearnArrayAdapter = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, codeLearnChapters);

Observe the parameters for creating ArrayAdapter: 

1. First Parameter is context
2. Second Parameter is the Layout, which this ArrayAdapter will use to bind the data from codeLearnChapters Array. Android comes pre bundled with some common layout which you can refer with android.R.layout. Here we are using - simple_list_item_1, which is just a simple text view. 
3. Third parameter is the data, in this case the String Array. 

Now that we have ArrayAdapter created, let's bind the Adapter with the listview.

Let's get the reference of listview 

        ListView codeLearnLessons = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.listView1);

Once you have a reference of listview, you can just call *setAdapter* method by passing the ArrayAdapter to be bound. 

        codeLearnLessons.setAdapter(codeLearnArrayAdapter);

With these simple 4 lines of code, you created your first listview. If you run the application downloaded from [here](https://github.com/pranayairan/Code-Learn-Android-Example/tree/master/CodeLearnListExample) and click on simpleAdapter button, you will see the array adapter in action. This is how it will look: 

<%= image_tag "list_view/Array_adapter.png", alt: "ArrayAdapters", title: "ArrayAdapters" %>

We have seen a simple ArrayAdapter, but most of the times you need more than 1 data in the listitem. Let's look how we can leverage base adapter class to achieve what we want. 

If you notice in the above example, we have used Android.R.Layout item. This is an inbuilt layout resource provided by Android to make your development fast. Here are some more examples of Listview items which Android provides:

* simple_list_item_1 : A list Item with single TextView
* simple_list_item_2 : A List Item  with 2 texviews in 2 different lines
* simple_expandable_list_item_1 : A List Item with Expandable View. List Items in listview can be of 2 types. First, which just displays all content(simple listview item).Second, an expandable listitem which contains some hidden data. This hidden data can be viewed if a user clicks on expand/collapse button. 
* simple_list_item_single_choice : A List Item with a radio button after textView. You can use this when you want to get a choice from the user.
* simple_list_item_multiple_choice: A List Item with a Check Box after textview. You can use this when you want to get multiple choices from the user. 


##Custom ListView with BaseAdapter

We have seen above what we can do with ArrayAdapter. But for most use cases you will have a complex layout for list items as below : 
<br/>
<%= image_tag "list_view/list_item.png", alt: "List Item", title: "List Item" %>

This kind of complex list items can be bound with BaseAdapter. With base Adapter you can practically build any layout which you want in your listview. 

###BaseAdapter
BaseAdapter is a common base class of a general implementation for an Adapter that can be used in ListView. BaseAdapter can be extended to create a custom Adapter to suit your need of building a custom listitem.

ArrayAdapter is also an implementation of BaseAdapter


###Android ListView Example (Custom Adapter)

Now since we understand the concepts of BaseAdapter, Let's Create our own Custom Adapter. 

To create a custom adapter all you need to do is create a new class then extends BaseAdapter, for example 

         public class CodeLearnAdapter extends BaseAdapter


With this simple line of code, you can create your own adapter. Once you extend the BaseAdapter, it will automatically ask you to implement the required method.  Just use Eclipse, add required methods to be implemented and it will automatically create the code for you. 

This is how your Custom Adapter will look like 

        public class CodeLearnAdapter extends BaseAdapter {

            @Override
            public int getCount() {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return 0;
            }

            @Override
            public Object getItem(int arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return null;
            }

            @Override
            public long getItemId(int arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return arg0;
            }

            @Override
            public View getView(int arg0, View arg1, ViewGroup arg2) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return null;
            }

        } 

###Understanding Custom Adapter Methods

Let's go step by step to understand each method of the custom adapter. 

* getCount() : This method tells the listview the number of rows it will require. This count can come from your data source. It can be the size of your Data Source. If you have your datasource as a list of objects, this value will be the size of the list. 
* Object getItem(int arg0): We have 2 method implementation of getItem. This method returns an object. This method helps ListView to get data for each row. The parameter passed is the row number starting from 0. In our List of Objects, this method will return the object at the passed index.
* long getItemId(int arg0) : You can ignore this method. It just returns the same value as passed. This in general helps ListView to map its rows to the data set elements. 
* getView : This is the most important method. This method will be called to get the View for each row. This is the method where we can use our custom listitem and bind it with the data. The fist argument passed to getView is the listview item position ie row number. The second parameter is recycled view reference(as we know listview recycles a view, you can confirm through this parameter). Third parameter is the parent to which this view will get attached to.

Now we understand all the methods of custom adapter. Let's create our own Custom ListView 

###Custom ListItem

First Step to have a custom ListView is to have a custom listitem. Let's create a custom listitem like this 
<br/>
<%= image_tag "list_view/list_item.png", alt: "List Item", title: "List Item" %>

This is similar to the one used in the twitter app.

This is the code for listitem. Look into *listitem.xml* in the sample project. 

        <RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
             >

            <ImageView
                android:id="@+id/imageView1"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
                android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
                
                android:src="@drawable/ic_launcher" />

            <TextView
                android:id="@+id/textView1"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginLeft="23dp"
                android:layout_marginTop="10dp"
                android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/imageView1"
                android:text="CodeLearn Chapter 1"
                android:textSize="16sp" />

            <TextView
                android:id="@+id/textView2"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/imageView1"
                android:layout_alignLeft="@+id/textView1"
                android:text="Description" />

        </RelativeLayout> 

###Data Source
Now since we have the custom listitem, we only need data. For this example project, we will just use a List of codeLearnChapter Objects which will have a chapter name and chapter description. Here is how the data structure of codeLearnChapter object looks like 

        public class codeLearnChapter {
                String chapterName;
                String chapterDescription;
            }

In the sample code, we have created a simple method getDataForListView which returns a populated list of codeLearnChapter objects. This is how the method looks

        public List<codeLearnChapter> getDataForListView()
        {
            List<codeLearnChapter> codeLearnChaptersList = new ArrayList<codeLearnChapter>();
            
            for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
            {
                
                codeLearnChapter chapter = new codeLearnChapter();
                chapter.chapterName = "Chapter "+i;
                chapter.chapterDescription = "This is description for chapter "+i;
                codeLearnChaptersList.add(chapter);
            }
            
            return codeLearnChaptersList;
            
        }

### Populating Custom Adapter
We now have a listitem, and also the data. Let's Create our own adapter. We have already created a custom adapter in the previous section, let's make some changes and put code in the methods.

*Getting the Data*
Let's get the data into our custom Adapter by calling getDataForListView method. We will create a new variable inside our custom adapter. 

        List<codeLearnChapter> codeLearnChapterList = getDataForListView();

*getCount*
Now we have the data, let's add code in getCount method. As discussed earlier, this method tells ListView how many rows it will have. In our case, this is the size of codeLearnChapterList. So let's return this size. 
        
        return codeLearnChapterList.size();

*Object getItem*
This method returns the object of the datasource at specified position. In our case, the object is of type codeLearnChapter. Let's modify the return type, and add a return statement. 

        @Override
            public codeLearnChapter getItem(int arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return codeLearnChapterList.get(arg0);
            }

*long getItemId*
Leave this method as it is, just make sure it is returning the same value that is passed. 
        
        return arg0;

*getView*

Now this is our main method where we will bind the listitem to the ListView. Since we want to use our own listitem, let's get the reference of our custom listitem. To add any new layout to an existing layout, you need to inflate the other layout. To inflate a layout you need to get the reference of LayoutInflater. 

        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) ListViewWithBaseAdapter.this.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

In this code, you just called getSystemService method by passing Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE. Getsystem service method is present in context. To get the reference of context, you can call **this** pointer on Activity,

Once you have the layout inflater object,  you just need to call inflate method on it. 

         View rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.listitem, arg2,false);

This inflates method takes 3 parameters, the layout which you want to add, the parent where the layout is being added , and third a boolean to attach the root to it's parent.  

Now we have a reference of listitem layout, but we know that listview recycles the views. Lets check the second parameter of getView to see if we already have te reference of listitem.

        if(arg1==null)
        {
            LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) ListViewWithBaseAdapter.this.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
            arg1 = inflater.inflate(R.layout.listitem, arg2,false);
        }

With this simple check, we can save the overhead of inflating a new view for each row. This will make our listview faster. 

Now we have the listitem, let's bind the data with the listview item.

*First let's get the reference of listitem elements*, in this case we want the reference of both the text views

        TextView chapterName = (TextView)arg1.findViewById(R.id.textView1);
        TextView chapterDesc = (TextView)arg1.findViewById(R.id.textView2);

*Now Let's get the Data* We have the list of codeLearnChapterList, let's call a get method on the list by passing the row id which is coming as 1st parameter of getView. 

        codeLearnChapter chapter = codeLearnChapterList.get(arg0);

*Binding Data* Now let's get data from chapter object and bind it to the textview. 

        chapterName.setText(chapter.chapterName);
        chapterDesc.setText(chapter.chapterDescription);


Now that we have done everything, time to just return the view 

        return arg1;

With this we have our custom Adapter ready to get binded to the listview. 

This is how the complete custom adapter looks : 

        public class CodeLearnAdapter extends BaseAdapter {

            List<codeLearnChapter> codeLearnChapterList = getDataForListView();
            @Override
            public int getCount() {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return codeLearnChapterList.size();
            }

            @Override
            public codeLearnChapter getItem(int arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return codeLearnChapterList.get(arg0);
            }

            @Override
            public long getItemId(int arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                return arg0;
            }

            @Override
            public View getView(int arg0, View arg1, ViewGroup arg2) {
                
                if(arg1==null)
                {
                    LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) ListViewWithBaseAdapter.this.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);
                    arg1 = inflater.inflate(R.layout.listitem, arg2,false);
                }
                
                TextView chapterName = (TextView)arg1.findViewById(R.id.textView1);
                TextView chapterDesc = (TextView)arg1.findViewById(R.id.textView2);
                
                codeLearnChapter chapter = codeLearnChapterList.get(arg0);
                
                chapterName.setText(chapter.chapterName);
                chapterDesc.setText(chapter.chapterDescription);
                
                return arg1;
            }

        }

###Binding Adapter with ListView

First Let us create the object of our custom adapter. 

        CodeLearnAdapter chapterListAdapter = new CodeLearnAdapter();

Now let us take the reference of the listview 

        ListView codeLearnLessons = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.listView1);

Now Let us bind the Adapter with ListView by calling setAdapter Method. 

        codeLearnLessons.setAdapter(chapterListAdapter);

This is how the ListView will look when you run it: 

<%= image_tag "list_view/Custom_Base_adapter.png", alt: "Custom Adapter", title: "Custom Adapter" %>


##ListView Click Listener

One important topic before we finish the ListView chapter is handling of the click event. Whenever a ListView item is clicked, listview's onItemClicked method is called. Let's see how this method looks like : 

        public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> arg0, View arg1, int arg2, long arg3) 

This method takes 4 parameters; First parameter is the AdapterView where the click happened. Second is the view within the adapter that was clicked. Third is the position of the view , and the last parameter is the row id of the item that is clicked. 

In this method, you can get the Object from the codeLeanChapterList. Let's Add one more method in our BaseAdapter which gives us this data. 

        public codeLeanChapter getCodeLearnChapter(int position)
        {
            return codeLeanChapterList.get(position);
        }

This method returns us the data at that row of ListView. Call this method inside the OnItemClick to get the data. Now you can perform any Business logic on this Data. In our example app, we will just display a Toast. 

This is how our click listener looks like :

        codeLearnLessons.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {

                @Override
                public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> arg0, View arg1, int arg2,
                        long arg3) {
                    
                    codeLeanChapter chapter = chapterListAdapter.getCodeLearnChapter(arg2);
                    
                    Toast.makeText(ListViewWithBaseAdapter.this, chapter.chapterName,Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                    
                }
            });


Now you get a fair understanding of how ListView works in Android. Let's See Some more tricks which can help you


##ListActivity 

In both of our examples, we have extended the Activity class and bound the listview. Though this is a simple way to do most of your work in android, android also comes with specialized Activities which can help you reduce the overall length of the code you write. These activities give you shortcut methods to make your development easier and faster. 

ListActivity is one such example of specialized activity which android offers. ListActivity is a subclass of Activity which makes creating, binding and using ListView simple. Before going deep into ListActivity, here are some of the advantages of using ListActivity. 

* List Activity Binds with a listview by default, no need to explicitly get the ListView object
* ListActvity holds a ListView object which can be bound by calling setAdapter anywhere in the code. 
* Since it holds the reference of the listview, you can directly add the click listener. 

Let's See how we can use ListActivity in our CustomAdapter Example. To do this, we will create a new Activity which will extend  ListActivity. 

**XML**

The first thing that will be changed while we use the ListActivity is the listview id in layout. ListActivity always expects the layout which you bind it with to have a listview with id *@android:id/list*. 

Why is this required ? If you recall, earlier we stated that ListActivity automatically holds the reference of a ListView. This is achieved via a common naming convention of the ListView whose object is instantiated in list activity automatically.

Go to list_view_list_activity.xml in our example project to see  ListView with a new id. 


**Extends**

To use ListActiviy just extend it in your class instead of an Activity. This will make the most of the boilerplate code available for you to use. 

**Binding Data**

In Case of ListActivity, you have the advantage of binding the adapter directly by calling *setListAdapter* method. 

Here is how you bind data in usual case, where you get the listview object and then call setAdapter on it.  

        ListView codeLearnLessons = (ListView)findViewById(R.id.listView1);
        codeLearnLessons.setAdapter(chapterListAdapter);

In case of ListActivity, you just need to call setListAdapter by passing the adapter: 
        
        setListAdapter(chapterListAdapter);


**Click Listener**

ListActivity provides you with a default method onListItemClick. This will be invoked every time someone clicks on a listview row. With this method, you don't need to set an explicit listener on your ListView. 

You can view the ListActivity example in the sample project that you downloaded. Refer to ListViewWithListActivity.java

>Watchout: ListActivity works well if you have only single ListView. In case you have more than one listview, you need to put extra code for the other ListView to work. 

You can download the sample app from [here](https://github.com/pranayairan/Code-Learn-Android-Example/tree/master/CodeLearnListExample)
