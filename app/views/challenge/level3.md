##Level 3 - Connecting to the real Twitter API using Twitter4J library

So far, the challenge involved the usage of the Codelearn Twitter API which provides dummy content. In this level, your task is to include [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html), a popular library for Java and Android that simplifies the use of Twitter API, and replace the existing network calls with the ones provided by Twitter4J.

###API, Request and Response

Refer to the [Javadoc](http://twitter4j.org/en/javadoc.html) and [code examples](http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html) provided by Twitter4J.

###Tasks
* Insert the relevant JAR files into your Eclipse project
* Register at [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com) and obtain consumer key and secret for your Twitter application.
* Replace the existing HTTP network mechanisms for logging in, fetching tweets and submitting new tweets with the methods provided by Twitter4J.
